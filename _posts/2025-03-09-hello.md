## Step 1: Installing Ruby & Jekyll

The first requirement for setting up Jekyll is having **Ruby** installed on your machine. To check if Ruby was already installed, I ran the following command in my terminal:

```bash
ruby -v
```

The terminal confirmed that Ruby was installed, so I proceeded to install Jekyll and Bundler using the command:
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```
However, I encountered an error:
```bash
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
    You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0 directory.
```

This error message indicated that I didn't have permission to modify the system-wide Ruby directory. Since macOS installs a system-managed version of Ruby, it restricts changes to the system directories for security reasons.

To solve this, I used a Ruby Version Manager (RVM), which allows me to manage Ruby versions independently of the system's default version. This solution would help me control and work on Ruby-based projects like Jekyll without running into permission issues.

Here's how I installed RVM using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install rbenv
```
After that, I added rbenv to my shell configuration by running:
```bash
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
Once rbenv was installed, I installed Ruby 3.2.2 with the following command:
```bash
rbenv install 3.2.2
```
To confirm that the installation worked, I ran the `ruby -v` command again and verified the correct version was installed. After that, I was able to successfully install Jekyll using the `gem` command.

## Step 2: Using the Chirpy Template
For the blog theme, I decided to use the Chirpy template from cotes2020. To get started, I visited their getting started page and followed the instructions to create a site repository using their template.

By following the link to the GitHub page, I created a new repository based on the Chirpy template.

Once the repository was created, I cloned it to my local machine using the git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nameofyourrepository
```
After cloning the repository, my terminal showed the following:
```bash
muffincodes.github.io git:(main)
```
Since I was following a video tutorial at this point, I tried to open the project in VS Code by typing:
```bash
code .
```
However, this didn't work because the `code` command wasn't in my system's PATH. To fix this, I followed the instructions to enable the "Open with Code" feature in VS Code. Here's how I did it:

In VS Code, press `Cmd + Shift + P` (or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette.

Type Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH and select this option.

VS Code then asked for my macOS password, and once I provided it, I was able to run the code . command, which opened the project folder in VS Code.

With these steps, I was able to set up my Jekyll blog and get started on customizing it. I'll be diving into the theme customization and adding content soonâ€”stay tuned for the next steps in my journey!
